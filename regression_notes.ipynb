    "\n",
    "- Correlation does not imply causation.\n",
    "    - Correlation measures the relationship between two variables. \n",
    "    - Doesn't capture causality but the degree of interrelation between the two variables. \n",
    "    - It's symmetrical regarding both variables; it goes both ways/the variables can be reversed while maintingin the relationship.\n",
    "    - The measure is a single point and cannot be represented as a line.\n",
    "    \n",
    "- Regression analysis is about how one variable affects the other. \n",
    "    - Based on causality. It only shows cause and effect, not the degree of the connection. \n",
    "    - Regression goes one way; you cannot revserse the variables and expect the same cause and effect relationship.\n",
    "    - Is represented by the best fitting line with the least amount of error."
